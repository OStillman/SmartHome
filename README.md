# Smart Home Controlled Via Pi

A Simple SmartHome service controled via a Raspberry Pi. 

Goal is for this to fill in the "gaps" left by the fairly dumb apps supplied with the likes of Google Home, Phillips Hue etc. such as if statements

Currently includes:
 - Front Door Sensor (Turn on hallway lights and alert in living room)
 - Basics of a traffic tracking app (For Work commutes)
